Please find my completed GHG Inventory assesment contained in this folder.

You can find the calculations and all associated work for the project in the Python notebook titled "GHG Inventory for No Name SemiChip Co.ipynb".
The original data can be found in "GHGProblemSet_March2023.xlsx".
All of the processed data is saved in .csv form for analysis and presentation in Power BI.
You can find the presentation slides here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iEJQz9lObaoD-0qqO7Ap8k2x2Y6lkdoF-r5H_9Fd3Ik/edit?usp=sharing
The Power BI dashboard will be included on the presentation slides since I do not have a personal paid account.
